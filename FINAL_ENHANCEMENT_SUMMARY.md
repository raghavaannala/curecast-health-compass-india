## 📋 **What You Requested**

> *"Enhance my existing healthcare chatbot so that it asks human-like follow-up questions whenever a user mentions a symptom or disease. The chatbot should behave like a doctor's assistant by asking context-based, step-by-step questions to understand the user's condition better. The questions must feel empathetic and human-like, not robotic."*

## ✅ **What Was Delivered**

### **🤖 Intelligent Symptom Assessment System**
Your chatbot now automatically detects when users mention symptoms and responds with:

1. **Empathetic Acknowledgment**
   ```
   "I understand you're feeling unwell with a fever. That can be quite uncomfortable. 
   Let me ask you a few questions to better understand your condition..."
   ```

2. **Human-like Follow-up Questions**
   ```
   "Since when have you been experiencing this fever? Has it been a few hours, days, or longer?"
   "How high would you say your fever is? Do you feel very hot, or is it a mild temperature?"
   "Along with the fever, are you experiencing any other symptoms like cough, body aches, or chills?"
   ```

3. **Comprehensive Final Assessment**
   - Possible conditions with likelihood
   - Immediate actions to take
   - When to see a doctor
