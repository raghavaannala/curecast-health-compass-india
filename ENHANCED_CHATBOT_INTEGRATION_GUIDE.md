## üîÑ **How It Works**

### **Step 1: Symptom Detection**
When a user mentions symptoms like "I have a fever" or "my head hurts":
```typescript
// Automatic detection of 40+ symptom keywords
const isSymptomMention = this.detectSymptomMention(message);
```

### **Step 2: Empathetic Response**
The chatbot responds with empathy before asking questions:
```
"I understand you're feeling unwell with a fever. That can be quite uncomfortable. 
Let me ask you a few questions to better understand your condition..."
```

### **Step 3: Human-like Follow-up Questions**
Context-aware questions that feel natural:
```
"Since how many days have you had the fever? Has it been a few hours, days, or longer?"
"How high would you say your fever is? Do you feel very hot, or is it a mild temperature?"
"Along with the fever, are you experiencing any other symptoms like cough, body aches, or chills?"
```

### **Step 4: Comprehensive Assessment**
Final assessment with:
- Possible conditions with probability
- Immediate actions to take
- When to see a doctor
- Home remedies
- Red flag warnings

---

## üöÄ **Integration Steps**

### **Option 1: Use Enhanced Chat Assistant (Recommended)**

Replace your existing chat component with the new enhanced version:

```tsx
import EnhancedChatAssistant from './components/EnhancedChatAssistant';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <EnhancedChatAssistant />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### **Option 2: Integrate with Existing Multilingual Chatbot**

Use the enhanced processing method in your existing chatbot:

```tsx
import { multilingualChatbotService } from './services/multilingualChatbotService';

// In your existing chatbot component
const handleMessage = async (message: string) => {
  const result = await multilingualChatbotService.processMessageWithSymptomAssessment(
    userId,
    message,
    'web', // platform
    sessionId,
    userAge, // optional
    userGender // optional
  );

  if (result.isSymptomAssessment) {
    // Handle symptom assessment flow
    if (result.assessmentComplete) {
      // Show final assessment
      console.log('Assessment complete:', result.assessmentResult);
    } else {
      // Continue with follow-up questions
      console.log('Next question:', result.response.content);
    }
  } else {
    // Regular chatbot response
    console.log('Regular response:', result.response.content);
  }
};
```

### **Option 3: Direct Symptom Assessment Service**

Use the symptom assessment service directly:

```tsx
import { symptomAssessmentService } from './services/symptomAssessmentService';

// Start assessment
const assessment = await symptomAssessmentService.startSymptomAssessment(
  userId,
  "I have a headache",
  'english',
  25, // age
  'female' // gender
);

console.log('Empathy:', assessment.empathyResponse);
console.log('First Question:', assessment.firstQuestion);

// Process answers
const result = await symptomAssessmentService.processAnswer(
  userId,
  "It started this morning",
  'english'
);

console.log('Acknowledgment:', result.acknowledgment);
if (result.nextQuestion) {
  console.log('Next Question:', result.nextQuestion);
}
```
